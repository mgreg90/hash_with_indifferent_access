# HashWithIndifferentAccess

This is just a simple implementation of ActiveSupport's HashWithIndifferentAccess.
I just wanted to take a stab at implementing this on my own without looking at
the ActiveSupport code. Maybe I'll use this in ruby projects that don't use
ActiveSupport. Maybe I'll turn this into a gem. Maybe I'll forget I wrote this
all together.

Time will tell.

Anyway, this thing seems to work. Feel free to comment/complain if you feel like
it or, god forbid, use it.
